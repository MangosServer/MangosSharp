 **MangosSharp0 - Vanilla WoW server**
===

**MangosSharp** is an open source project written in [C#][7]. It's fast and stores game data in 
[MySQL][40] or [MariaDB][41].

If you liked the original incarnation of [World of Warcraft][2] and still want to play it,
this is the branch for you. We provide an authentication server where you can manage your users, 
and a world server which serves game content just like the original did back then.

It aims to be 100% compatible with the 3 final versions of Vanilla [World of Warcraft][2], 
namely [patch 1.12.1][4], [patch 1.12.2][5] & [patch 1.12.3][6].
<br>**IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 1.13.x** and beyond which is the newly released Classic Experience (NuClassic).


Requirements
------------
    Supported platforms: Windows 8+, Linux, MacOS, Docker
    .NET 6 sdk
    MySQL 8.0
    Visual Studio 2022 or any other editor with .NET 6 support


Dependencies
------------
The server stands on the shoulders of several well-known Open Source libraries plus
a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from inventing the wheel again.

* **[MySQL][40]** / **[MariaDB][41]**: These databases are used to store content and user data.


<br>We have a small, but extremely friendly and helpful community managed by MadMax and Antz.


Our discord/forum motto is: 
```js
'Be nice or Be somewhere else'
```
Any trolling or unpleasantness is swiftly dealt with !!
